# analysis code based on ntuples from Heppy

Bph Jpsi+Upsilon for 80x

The branch 8025 (master synced to this latest version) is built up based on the Ntuples produced with the Heppy_8025 bph4l packages.
The ntuple structures were chagned in the input trees, thus the whole code is going to be changed compared to the 8019 branch.
